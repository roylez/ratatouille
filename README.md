Ratatouille is a declarative terminal UI kit for Elixir for building rich
text-based terminal applications similar to how you write HTML.

It builds on top of the [termbox][termbox] API (using the Elixir bindings from
[ex_termbox][ex_termbox]).

For the API Reference, see: [https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille).

## Getting Started

Ratatouille implements [The Elm Architecture][tea] (TEA) as a way to structure
application logic. This fits quite naturally in Elixir and is part of what makes
Ratatouille declarative. If you've already used TEA on the web, this should feel
very familiar.

As with a GenServer definition, Ratatouille apps only implement a behaviour by
defining callbacks and don't know how to start or run themselves. It's the
application runtime that handles all of those (sometimes tricky) details.

[tea]: https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/

### Building an Application

Let's build a simple application that displays an integer counter which can be
incremented when the user presses `+` and decremented when the user presses `-`.

First a quick clarification, since we're using the word "application" a lot. For
our purposes, an application is a terminal application, and not necessarily an
OTP application, but your terminal application could also be an OTP
application. We'll cover that in [Packaging and Distributing
Applications](#packaging-and-distributing) below.

Back to the counter app. First we'll look at the entire example, then we'll go
through it line by line to see what each line does. You can also find this
example [in the repo][counter_example] and run it with `mix run`.

[counter_example]: https://github.com/ndreynolds/ratatouille/blob/master/examples/counter.exs

```elixir
# examples/counter.exs

defmodule Counter do
  @behaviour Ratatouille.App

  import Ratatouille.View

  def init(_context), do: 0

  def update(model, msg) do
    case msg do
      {:event, %{ch: ?+}} -> model + 1
      {:event, %{ch: ?-}} -> model - 1
      _ -> model
    end
  end

  def render(model) do
    view do
      label(content: "Counter is #{model} (+/-)")
    end
  end
end

Ratatouille.run(Counter)
```

At the top, we define a new module (`Counter`) for the app and we inform Elixir
that it will implement the `Ratatouille.App` behaviour. This just ensures we're
warned if we forget to implement a callback and serves as documentation that
this is a Ratatouille app.

```elixir
defmodule Counter do
  @behaviour Ratatouille.App

  # ...
end
```

Next, we import the View DSL from
[`Ratatouille.View`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View):

```elixir
import Ratatouille.View
```

The View DSL provides element builder functions like `view`, `row`, `table`,
`label` that you can use to define views. Think of them like HTML tags.

#### `init/1`

The `init/1` callback defines the initial model. "Model" is the Elm
architecture's term for what we often call "state" in Elixir/Erlang. As with a
GenServer, the state (our model) will later be passed to callbacks when things
happen in order to allow the app to update it.

The model can be any Erlang term. For larger apps, it's helpful to use maps or
structs to organize different pieces of the state. Here, we just have an integer
counter, so we return `0` as our initial model:

```elixir
defmodule Counter do
  # ...

  def init(_context), do: 0

  # ...
end
```

#### `update/2`

The `update/2` callback defines how to transform the model when a particular
message is received. Ratatouille's runtime will automatically call `update/2`
when terminal events occur (pressing a key, resizing the window, clicking the
mouse, etc.). We can also send ourselves messages via subscriptions and commands.

Here, we'd like to increment the counter when we get a `?+` key press and
decrement it when get a `?-`. Event messages are based on the underlying termbox
events and characters are given as code points (e.g., `?a` is `97`).

```elixir
defmodule Counter do
  # ...

  def update(model, msg) do
    case msg do
      {:event, %{ch: ?+}} -> model + 1
      {:event, %{ch: ?-}} -> model - 1
      _ -> model
    end
  end

  # ...
end
```

It's a good idea to provide a fallback clause in case we don't know how to
handle a message. This way the app won't crash if the user presses a key that
the app doesn't handle. But if things stop working as you expect, try removing
the fallback to see if important messages are going unmatched.

#### `render/1`

The `render/1` callback defines a view to display the model. The runtime will
call it as needed when it needs to update the terminal window.

Like an HTML document, a view is defined as a tree of elements (nodes).
Elements have attributes (e.g., `text: bold`) and children (nested content).
While helper functions can return arbitrary element trees, the `render/1`
callback must return a view tree starting with a root `view` element---it's
sort of like the `<body>` tag in HTML.

```elixir
defmodule Counter do
  # ...

  def render(model) do
    view do
      label(content: "Counter is #{model} (+/-)")
    end
  end

  # ...
end
```

#### Running it

There's a final and very important line at the bottom:

```elixir
Ratatouille.run(Counter)
```

This starts the application runtime with our app definition. Options can be
passed as a second argument. This is an easy way to run simple apps. For more
complicated ones, it's recommended to define an OTP application.

That's it---now you can run the program with `mix run <file>`. To run the
bundled example:

```bash
$ mix run examples/counter.exs
```

You should see the counter we defined, be able to make changes to it with `+`
and `-`, and be able to quit using `q`.

## Views

Ratatouille's views are trees of elements similar to HTML in structure. For
example, here's how to define a two-column layout:

```elixir
view do
  row do
    column size: 6 do
      panel title: "Left Column" do
        label(content: "Text on the left")
      end
    end

    column size: 6 do
      panel title: "Right Column" do
        label(content: "Text on the right")
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### The DSL

As you might have noticed, Ratatouille provides a small DSL on top of Elixir for
defining views. These are functions and macros which accept attributes and/or
child elements in different formats. For example, a `column` element can be
defined in all of the following ways:

```elixir
column()

column(size: 12)

column do
  # ... child elements ...
end

column size: 12 do
  # ... child elements ...
end
```

All of these evaluate to a `%Ratatouille.Renderer.Element{tag: :column}` struct.
The macros provide syntactic sugar, but under the hood it's all structs.

Here's a list of all the elements provided by `Ratatouille.View`:

| Element | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`bar`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#bar/0) | Block-level element for creating title, status or menu bars |
| [`canvas`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#canvas/0) | A free-form canvas for drawing arbitrary shapes |
| [`canvas_cell`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#canvas_cell/0) | A canvas cell which represents one square of the canvas |
| [`chart`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#chart/0) | Element for plotting a series as a multi-line chart |
| [`column`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#column/0) | Container occupying a vertical segment of the grid |
| [`label`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#label/0) | Block-level element for displaying text |
| [`overlay`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#overlay/0) | Container overlaid on top of the view |
| [`panel`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#panel/0) | Container with a border and title used to demarcate content |
| [`row`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#row/0) | Container used to define grid layouts with one or more columns |
| [`sparkline`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#sparkline/0) | Element for plotting a series in a single line |
| [`table`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#table/0) | Container for displaying data in rows and columns |
| [`table_cell`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#table_cell/0) | Element representing a table cell |
| [`table_row`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#table_row/0) | Container representing a row of the table |
| [`text`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#text/0) | Inline element for displaying uniformly-styled text |
| [`tree`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#tree/0) | Container for displaying data as a tree of nodes |
| [`tree_node`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#tree_node/0) | Container representing a tree node |
| [`view`](https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/Ratatouille.View.html#view/0) | Top-level container |

### Adding Logic

Because it's just Elixir code, you can freely mix in Elixir syntax and abstract
views using functions:

```elixir
label(content: a_variable)

view do
  case current_tab do
    :one -> render_tab_one()
    :two -> render_tab_two()
  end
end
```

```elixir
if window.width > 80 do
  row do
    column(size: 6)
    column(size: 6)
  end
else
  row do
    column(size: 12)
  end
end
```

### Styling

Attributes are used to style text and other content:

```elixir
# Labels are block-level, so this makes text within the whole block red.
label(content: "Red text", color: :red)

# Nested inline text elements can be used to style differently within a label.
label do
  text(content: "R", color: :red)
  text(content: "G", color: :green)
  text(content: "B", color: :blue)
end

# `color` sets the foreground, while `background` sets the background.
label(content: "Black on white", color: :black, background: :white)

# `attributes` accepts a list of text attributes, here `:bold` and `:underline`.
label(content: "Bold and underlined text", attributes: [:bold, :underline])
```

Styling is still being developed, so it's not currently possible to style every
aspect of every element, but this will improve with time.

### Views are Strict

Most web browsers will happily try to make sense of any HTML you give them. For
example, you can put a `td` directly under a `div` and the content will likely
still be rendered.

Ratatouille takes a different, more strict approach and first validates that the
view tree is well-structured. If it's not valid, an error is raised explaining
the problem. This is intended to provide quick feedback when something's wrong.
Restricting the set of valid views also helps to simplify the rendering
implementation.

It's helpful to keep the following things in mind when defining views:

* Each tag has a list of allowed child tags. For example, a `row` may only have
  elements with the `column` tag as direct descendants.
* Each tag has a list of attributes. Some attributes are required, and these
  must be set. Optional attributes have some default behavior when unset. It's
  not allowed to set an attribute that's not in the list.
* A `view` element must be the root element of any view tree you'd like to
  render.

See the list of elements above for documentation on each element.

## Example Applications

(unless indicated otherwise).

## Under the Hood

The application runtime abstracts away many of the details concerning how the
terminal window is updated and how events are received. If you're interested in
how these things actually work, or if the runtime doesn't support your use case,
see this guide:

<https://hexdocs.pm/ratatouille/under-the-hood.html>

## Packaging and Distributing

*Warning: This part is still rough around the edges.*

While it's easy to run apps while developing with `mix run`, packaging them for
others to easily run is a bit more complicated. Depending on the type of app
you're building, it might not be reasonable to assume that users have any
Elixir or Erlang tools installed. Terminal apps are usually distributed as
binary executables so that they can just be run as such without additional
dependencies. Fortunately, this is possible using OTP releases that bundle
ERTS.

### Defining an OTP Application

In order to create an OTP release, we first need to define an OTP application
that runs the terminal application. `Ratatouille.Runtime.Supervisor` takes care
of starting all the necessary runtime components, so we start this supervisor
under the OTP application supervisor and pass it a Ratatouille app definition
(along with any other runtime configuration).

For example, the OTP application for toby looks like this:

```elixir
defmodule Toby do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {Ratatouille.Runtime.Supervisor, runtime: [app: Toby.App]},
      # other workers...
    ]

    Supervisor.start_link(
      children,
      strategy: :one_for_one,
      name: Toby.Supervisor
    )
  end
end
```

### Executable Releases with Distillery

We'll use Distillery to create the OTP release, as it can even create
distributable, self-contained executables. Releases built on a given
architecture can generally be run on machines of the same architecture.

Follow the Distillery guide to generate a release configuration:

<https://hexdocs.pm/distillery/introduction/installation.html>

In order to make a "batteries-included" release, it's important that you have
`include_erts` set to `true`:

``` elixir
environment :prod do
  # ...
  set(include_erts: true)
  # ...
end
```

Now it's possible to generate the release:

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix release --executable --transient
```

This creates a Distillery release that bundles the Erlang runtime and the
application. Start it in the foreground, e.g.:

```bash
_build/prod/rel/toby/bin/toby.run foreground
```

You can also move this executable somewhere else (e.g., to a directory in your
$PATH). A current caveat is that it must be able to unpack itself, as Distillery
executables are self-extracting archives.

## Projects using Ratatouille

For inspiration or ideas on how to structure your application, check out this list of
projects built with Ratatouille:

* [`tefter/cli`](https://github.com/tefter/cli) - the command-line client for Tefter
* [`toby`](https://github.com/ndreynolds/toby) - a terminal-based Erlang observer

If you have a project you'd like to include here, just open a PR to add it to the list.

## Installation

### From Hex

Add Ratatouille as a dependency in your project's `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:ratatouille, "~> 0.5.0"}
  ]
end
```

### From Source

To try out the master branch, first clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ndreynolds/ratatouille.git
cd ratatouille
```

Next, fetch the deps:

```
mix deps.get
```

Finally, try out one of the included [`examples/`][examples]:

```
mix run examples/rendering.exs
```

If you see lots of things drawn on your terminal screen, you're good to go. Use
"q" to quit in the examples (unless otherwise specified).

## Roadmap

* Apps
  * [x] Application Runtime
  * [x] Subscriptions
  * [x] Commands
* Views / Rendering
  * [x] Rendering engine with basic elements
  * [ ] More configurable charts (axis label, color, multiple lines, etc.)
  * [ ] Uniform support for text styling (incl. inheritance)
  * [x] Automatic translation to termbox styling constants
    * For example, `color: :red` instead of `color: Constants.color(:red)`.
  * [ ] Rendering optimizations (view diffing, more efficient updates, etc.)
* Events
  * [ ] Translate termbox events to a cleaner format
    * Dealing with the integer constants is inconvenient. These could be
      converted to atoms by the event manager.
* Terminal Backend
  * [x] ex_termbox NIFs
  * [ ] Alternative port-based termbox backend
* Customization
  * [ ] Registering custom element renderers
    * This would support using custom elements (e.g. `my_table()`) that are
      defined outside of the core library.

## Contributing

Contributions are much appreciated. They don't necessarily have to come in the
form of code, I'm also very thankful for bug reports, documentation
improvements, questions, and suggestions.

### Running the Tests

Run the unit tests as usual:

```
mix test
```

Ratatouille also includes integration tests of the bundled examples. These
aren't included in the default suite because they actually run the example apps.
The integration suite can be run like so:

```
mix test --only integration
```
